# Cursor Rules — Node.js + Express + TypeScript

## General Principles
- Use TypeScript strictly (no `any`)
- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Follow existing ESLint and Prettier rules
- Do not introduce new dependencies without asking
- Generate code that is easy to read and maintain

## Language & Types
- Always use explicit types for function parameters and return values
- Use `unknown` instead of `any` when the type is not known
- Prefer interfaces or type aliases for objects
- Avoid type assertions (`as`) unless absolutely necessary

## Node.js & Express
- Use async/await for all asynchronous code
- Do not use callbacks unless required by a library
- Handle errors explicitly and consistently
- Never swallow errors silently
- Use centralized error handling middleware

## Project Structure

Suggested structure:
- `/modules` — Modules
    Inside modules
      - `/core` — Core
        Inside core
          - `/types` — Types, Interfaces, Models
          - `/constants` — Constants
          - `/enums` — Constants
          - `/services` - Services
    module.ts - Main file of module
- `/core` - Core
  Inside core global things
    - `/types` — Global Types, Interfaces, Models
    - `/constants` — Global Constants
    - `/enums` — Global Constants
    - `/services` - Global Services
    - `/providers` - Global providers

## Code Style
- Use named exports (no default exports)
- Prefer early returns
- Avoid deeply nested conditionals
- Keep functions small (one responsibility)
- Avoid magic numbers and strings

## Formatting & Linting
- Assume ESLint and Prettier are enabled
- Do not disable lint rules unless explicitly asked
- Generated code must pass linting without warnings

## Testing
- Do NOT generate unit or integration tests
- Do NOT suggest testing libraries unless asked

## Communication
- If requirements are unclear, ask a clarifying question
- Explain non-obvious decisions briefly
- Do not over-explain simple code
